# tmdb
A simple app to pull movie data from TMDB

Build a popular movie browsing app using Python.

Sign up for a [TMDb account and request an API key](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api?language=en). Use the [popular movies endpoint](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-popular-movies) to display a list of the current popular movies in
your app. Users should be able to select a movie from the list to view details about it.

Your "app" can have any kind of UI you want. The UI should be simple and focus on basic
functionality. The only requirement is that you use either Flask or Django.
The focus of this assignment is on using an API and your modeling the data. For the user
interface, display as little information as you need to. The only required data are:

* title
* release_date
* popularity
